## 🤔 About

HVA functional-programming

## 🔍 Research question

Where do I have the most chance to find a parking location?

### Datasets needed

- Location of parking spots
  [GEO-Parkeer-Garages](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/GEO-Parkeer-Garages/t5pc-eb34) (Parking garages locations)
- Where are the most parking spots?
  [Open-Data-Parkeren-SPECIFICATIES-PARKEERGEBIED](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/Open-Data-Parkeren-SPECIFICATIES-PARKEERGEBIED/b3us-f26s) (capacity of parking garages)
- How many parking spots are filled (preferably realtime)

### Assumptions

There is less chance to find a parking spot in the middle of a city than more on the outside
You have a higher chance to find a parking spot throughout the week than in the weekend.
